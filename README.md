# Cpp_QR_code_generator


## Building the Project

This project uses **Conan** to manage dependencies.

### On Visual Studio
- Download Conan Extension for Visual Studio [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=conan-io.conan-vs-extension)
- Download the wxwidgets library from the extension
  and you are done *you can do it without the extension if it deosn't work with you*
- finally you can build it to any arch. you want (x64 , x86) on release or debug.

# I used the following libraries:
- **qrcodegen**: For generating QR codes. [Link to Project](https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator/tree/master)
- **wxWidgets** For GUI [Link to Project](https://www.wxwidgets.org/)

Obviously I used **C++** as the programming language for this project.
